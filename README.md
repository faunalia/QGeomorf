# QGeomorf
Geomorphology plugin for QGIS

Waiting for publication, you can test it at the early stages of development by:

* dowloading the zipzile (button on this page, at the right)
* unzipping it in ~/.qgis2/pyton/plugins
* renaming it, removing the trailing `-master`
* activating it in the Plugin manager
* activating it under Processing > Options > QGeomorf

Enjoy.
